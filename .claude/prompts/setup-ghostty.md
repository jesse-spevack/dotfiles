# Setup Ghostty Terminal from Dotfiles

I want to set up Ghostty terminal emulator on my macOS machine using the configuration from my dotfiles repository: https://github.com/jesse-spevack/dotfiles

Please guide me through the setup process step-by-step, explaining each component and asking if I need it before installing or configuring anything.

## What I Need Help With

1. **Installing Ghostty** - Check if it's installed, if not, guide me through installation
2. **Font Installation** - The config uses JetBrainsMono Nerd Font - explain what it is and ask if I want it
3. **Theme Setup** - The config uses Catppuccin Mocha theme - explain and confirm
4. **Configuration** - Use GNU Stow to symlink the Ghostty config from the repo
5. **Dependencies** - Any other tools or setup needed

## Process Requirements

For each step:
- Explain what the component is and why it's needed
- Show me what will be installed/configured
- Ask if I want to proceed before making any changes
- Verify each step completed successfully

## Configuration Details

Reference the Ghostty configuration at: `ghostty/.config/ghostty/config` in the repo

The configuration includes:
- Theme: Catppuccin Mocha
- Font: JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono at size 19
- Visual effects: background blur and opacity
- macOS-specific settings
- Unicode rendering fixes

Please walk me through this systematically, one item at a time.
